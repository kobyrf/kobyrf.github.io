description: Ball milling SnCl2 + KA' produced an unsolvated stannate, but also a tetra-allyltin species arising from the first example of mechanochemically induced redox. Based on its instability in solution and dispersion-corrected DFT, the tetra-allyltin is stabilized by inter-ligand dispersion that is interrupted by solvents
