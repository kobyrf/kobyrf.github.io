# **Research**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a 4th year PhD student at Vanderbilt University studying  chemistry under Dr. Timothy Hanusa. You are reading my personal website, so thank you for visiting! I wanted to make a website to have a place on the internet that would serve as an online CV and I could blog from, and make me searchable. I have made this website using GitHub Pages, which implements Jekyll. This is based on the PortfolYOU template at [Youssef Nasry] (https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) by Youssef Raafat. Please excuse any non-functional sections, it's a work in progress :)
