# **Research**
I am a 4th year PhD student in Dr. Timothy Hanusa's research group. We are primarily focused on
using mechanochemistry to make new organometallic compounds. We do this primarily using planetary or mixer mills. Avoiding or reducing the amount of solvent we use has a variety of interesting outcomes. We can probe how solvent helps and hinders chemical reactions, by varying the type and amount of solvent at different steps of synthesis. Since solvents can take up a coordination site in polar organometallic compounds, the molecules we synthesize are often novel and can only be obtained under solvent-free conditions. With out the thermodynamic anchor of say, a M-O interaction with THF or diethyl ether, our compounds are uncharacteristically active as catalysts or polymerization initiators. Mechanochemical reactions may proceed extremely rapidly and are functionally at an extremely high concentration, providing the opportunity to isolate and favor unique products. The ability to stop and start mechanochemical reactions enables the trapping of what otherwise would be reactive intermediates that may not be stable in solution, or would not survive the amount of time it takes to heat up and cool down a reaction.

Under mechanochemical conditions, solubility of starting materials is not a concern, allowing the use of cheaper, safer, or more ideal reagents.
