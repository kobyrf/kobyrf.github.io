# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a 4th year PhD student at Vanderbilt University studying  chemistry under Dr. Timothy Hanusa. You are reading my personal website, so thank you for visiting! I wanted to make a website to have a place on the internet that would serve as an online CV and I could blog from, and make me searchable. I have made this website using GitHub Pages, which implements Jekyll. This is based on the PortfolYOU template at https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU by Youssef Raafat. Please excuse any non-functional sections, it's a work in progress :)

# **Other Interests**
I'm an avid music fan, mostly on the rock side. I've been playing
electric bass since I was 12 and am working on picking up the guitar again.
I currently play bass in Pepper Said https://www.peppersaid.com/
and my hometown high school / college town Southpaws (with some of my best friends) has still not broken up https://southpavvs.bandcamp.com/
