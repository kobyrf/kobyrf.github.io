# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a 4th year PhD student at Vanderbilt University studying  chemistry under Dr. Timothy Hanusa. You are reading my personal website, so thank you for visiting! I wanted to make a website to have a place on the internet that would serve as an online CV and I could blog from, and make me searchable. I have made this website using GitHub Pages, which implements Jekyll. This is based on the [PortfolYOU template](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU) by Youssef Raafat. Please excuse any non-functional sections, it's a work in progress and learning exercise :)

# **Other Interests**
I'm an avid music fan, mostly on the rock side. I've been playing
electric bass since I was 12 and am working on picking up the guitar again.
I currently play bass in [Pepper Said](https://www.peppersaid.com/)
and my hometown high school / college town [Southpaws](https://southpavvs.bandcamp.com/) (with some of my best friends) has still not broken up.

I'm a fan of just about anything creative, I enjoy reading, playing video games, music, movies, art, museums, etc.
I used to be pretty obsessed with coffee and have been pretty happy with the [Prismo](https://fellowproducts.com/products/prismo), a replacement filter cap that has a pressure valve and removable metal filter. This lets you avoid using paper filters and build more pressure for a more espresso-like cup. I like to use the inverted method.

I also enjoy road cycling and rock climbing though I'm pretty much a novice at both.
