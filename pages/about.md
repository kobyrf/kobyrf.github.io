# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a 4th year PhD student at Vanderbilt University studying  chemistry under Dr. Timothy Hanusa. You are reading my personal website, so thank you for visiting! I wanted to make a website to have a place on the internet that would serve as an online CV and I could blog from, and make me searchable. I have made this website using GitHub Pages, which implements Jekyll. This is based on the PortfolYOU template at https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU by Youssef Raafat. Please excuse any non-functional sections, it's a work in progress :)

<div class="row">
 A: **Gaussian**
   Most of the work I do is with Gaussian

 B: **ORCA**
   " I'm in the process of becoming comfortable with ORCA, it's great
   to have the option to use free software, and it is supposed to be very fast due
   to some of the approximations it can make. "
