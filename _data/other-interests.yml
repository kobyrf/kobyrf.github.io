  description: "I'm an avid music fan, mostly on the rock side. I've been playing electric bass since I was 12 and am working on picking up the guitar again.
                I currently play bass in Pepper Said https://www.peppersaid.com/ and my hometown high school / college town Southpaws (with some of my best friends) has still not broken up https://southpavvs.bandcamp.com/ "
