  description: From my sophomore to my senior year, I did research under the
  supervision of ""Tomislav Friščić"" in the sustainable synthesis of ""metal-organic""
  frameworks, organic frameworks, and organometallics. As you may have guessed,
  this inspired my continued interest in ""m-chem"" and organometallics. In addition,
   I was heavily involved in the Chemistry undergraduate student society.

  description: In January of 2017 after rotations, I officially joined the Hanusa
  group. I've worked on a variety of projects that are listed under the projects
  section of this site. I'm very proud that I can show that mechanochemistry and
  other sustainable techniques are really spectacular synthetic techniques that
  may reshape how we think about chemistry. During this time, I have also learned
  a lot about DFT with the help of my supervisor, which has been integral for
  almost all of my work, since many of the molecules we isolate are sensitive or transient.
